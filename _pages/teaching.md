### Introduction of Diffusion (ISW, Winter 2023, UBC)

Over four weekends in November and December 2023, I participated in a postdoc instructional skills workshop (ISW)
offered by the Centre for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning ([CIRTL](https://cirtl.ubc.ca/)) at UBC.
The workshop focused on the theory and practice of evidence-based teaching techniques,
where we learned various elements of learner-centred lesson design and taught three short lessons to each other.
My topic was about diffusion (Brownian motion, the Stokes-Einstein equation, and the kinetic theory),
and I was teaching it to an audience from diverse disciplines (from biology to psychology).
Overall, it was an engaging and helpful workshop.

### Applications of Classical Mechanics (PHYS 350, Winter 2022, UBC)

This was an undergrad course on classical mechanics (e.g. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics),
instructed by Prof. [Mona Berciu](https://phas.ubc.ca/~berciu/).
I gave a guest lecture near the end of the course on the topic of
*Q-learning*, based on the example of a simple microswimmer.
The detailed course materials (lecture notes and demo code) are

### Boundary Layer & Heat Engines Labs (SG1217, SG2214, SG1216, 2016-2019, KTH)

These labs were part of the degree program for Engineering Physics and
Aerospace/Vehicle Engineering students at KTH (mainly BSc level).
Each lab took 2-3 hours and involved 3-5 students.
My role as the lab instructor was to help the students connect the theory to reality,
as well as to make sure they were safe during the experiments.
*Fun fact*: We were interviewed by the Swedish National TV during one
[experiment](/images/svt_kth_lab.png)!

### Dynamics of Fluids (AME 309, 2014-2015, USC)

This was an undergraduate course on fluid dynamics.
I was grading the homework assignments of around 50 students
for Prof. [Veronica Eliasson](http://eliasson.mines.edu/)
and Dr. David C. Wilcox (inventor of the _k-Ï‰_ model), respectively.
