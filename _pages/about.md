I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) in Toronto, Canada. Prior to this, I was a postdoc at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and later a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University.

My research lies at the intersection of complex fluids and active matter. I study how single, multiple, and even suspensions of active particles swim in inhomogeneous environments characterized by gradients in fluid viscosity, density, and stiffness. Using a combination of asymptotics and numerical simulations, I investigate the hydrodynamic mechanisms governing particle motion in such environments. This work not only deepens our understanding of active matter physics but also has potential applications in areas such as targeted drug delivery and biofuel production. Recently, I have been exploring the use of AI/ML tools to advance this research.
